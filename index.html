      <p>Rajputana has a proud place in Indian history. The warriors here never hesitated to sacrifice their lives for the protection of country, caste, religion and freedom. The whole of India is proud of his sacrifice. In this land of heroes, there were many small and big states of Rajputs who fought for the independence of India. In these states, Mewar has its own special place in which history's pride Bappa Rawal, Khuman I Maharana Hammir, Maharana Kumbha, Maharana Sanga, Uday Singh and Veer Shiromani Maharana Pratap were born.</p>
